## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Set Up First, Use Later

It is **strongly recommended** to configure **all GUI layouts and pages before using them in gameplay**.

Doing so will:

* Improve performance
* Speed up development
* Reduce runtime changes

---

## How to Make a GUI

### ⚙️ Initial Setup

After installing the datapack:

* **Singleplayer:** Rejoin the world
* **Server:** Restart the server

This is required because GUI Maker uses Minecraft’s **dialog system**, which only reloads on world restart.

---

### Step 1: Create a GUI

1. Run:

   ```mcfunction
   /function gm:menu
   ```
2. Click **CREATE GUI**
3. Click **CREATE GUI PROFILE**
4. A **GUI ID** will appear in chat — save it
5. Reopen the menu
6. Click **CREATE GUI → Append a Page**
7. Select your GUI using the saved GUI ID

Your GUI is now created.

---

### Step 2: Edit a Page

1. Open the menu again:

   ```mcfunction
   /function gm:menu
   ```
2. Click **Edit Page**
3. Select your **GUI ID** and **Page**
4. Choose between:

   * Editing Page Name
   * Editing Contents
5. When editing contents:

   * A prototype layout will appear
   * Only occupied slots are shown
   * Hover over buttons to identify items
6. Click a button to modify it
7. Fill in all required fields and click **Apply**

> ⚠️ Do not leave text inputs empty.

---

### Step 3: Spawn the GUI

1. Open the menu again
2. Click **Spawn GUI**
3. Select the page to spawn
4. Choose a spawn type:

   * Barrel
   * Chest Minecart
5. A command will appear in chat

   * This command can be copied and reused in your own datapacks

## Usage Rules

* ❌ **Do NOT** re‑upload this datapack as‑is
